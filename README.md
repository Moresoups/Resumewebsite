 my Resume and portfolio website


a website with my resume and portfolio. made for a class challenge. contains all of my past projects including animation, playwriting, TOWER, and of course, coding.

All code is my own work with special thanks to www.w3schools.com for helpful tips and tricks which really helped me when I was stuck

all videos and images are my own works with the exception of the animated red acai man, the two stop motion images and the construction man. all of these fall under fair use and had no royalty or other disclamers.
