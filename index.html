   ● Worked with Tom Dulack in order to create a theater summer camp in 2018. I did anything asked of me as we were a small crew but my primary responsibilities included teaching the kids, creating the schedules and setting up the stage. I also built the props and ran the camp’s outreach program which was instrumental in finding kids

                    <h2>TOWER</h2>
                    
<pre>
    TOWER is a game in which Players attempt the seemingly insurmountable task of exploring the ruins that once was our afterlife. In their treacherous journeys, they will encounter the restless and warped spirits of the dead, The maddened remaining population, the crazed Automations that still tend to the decrepit tower even after the abandonment of their human masters, and much more! Together, you will piece together just what exactly happened to this place.
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FeWBnhgX0AI_U8R?format=jpg&name=small" alt="Tower game on a table">
best described as an  Action RPG, TOWER is a game in which you are pitted against the horrors of our post-apocalyptic afterlife. This game supports 2-7 players but recommends a party of 4-5 for a stable difficulty.   
The game is made up of hundreds of loot cards and enemy cards. Due to the high volume of cards and the unique play styles of the starting classes, no two games will be the same and your character’s builds will differ wildly which will substantially alter your playstyle game to game.

It will be up to you to make use of all the resources available to you and corporate with your fellow party members for you to have any hope of victory. The game also centers around the exploration through the forgotten corridors of the Tower and its secrets. The game rewards dangerous explorations with the temptation of rarer loot, just be careful you don’t stay to far! 
The game also features intense and unique boss fights that will truly test your item synergies and teamwork. The game ends when the final boss at the top of the tower is beaten!
